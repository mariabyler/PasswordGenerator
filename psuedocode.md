want user to be able to select length of password (8-128)
    want user to have a prompt that will allow them to type in a number
    take value from prompt and determine where that number falls in the range
    if it's an allowable length
determine the type of character
    let them know if those characters are allowable (error message)
choose between yes and no if they want special characters, uppercase, numbers
store those choices for later action 
use the length + options to generate 
    joining arrays (pick from the selected pool to build out password)
